======
//Forked group repo that we all worked on to submit. I'd mistakenly thought this was already submitted.

## Submission Instructions
x Work in a fork of this repository
x Work in a branch on your fork
x Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
x Open a pull request to this repository
x Submit on canvas a question and observation, how long you spent, and a link to your pull request

## Configuration
Configure the root of your repository with the following files and directories. Thoughfully name and organize any aditional configuration or module files.
x **README.md** - contains documentation
x **.env** - contains env variables (should be git ignored)
x **.gitignore** - contains a [robust](http://gitignore.io) `.gitignore` file
x **.eslintrc** - contains the course linter configuratoin
x **.eslintignore** - contains the course linter ignore configuration
x **package.json** - contains npm package config
  * create a `lint` script for running eslint
  * create a `test` script for running tests
  * create a `start` script for running your server
x **lib/** - contains module definitions
x **\_\_test\_\_/** - contains unit tests

## Feature Tasks
For this assignment you will be building a HTTP server.
#### Body Parser Module
#### URL Parser Module
#### Server Module
The server module is responsible for creating an http server defining all route behavior and exporting an interface for starting and stoping the server. It should export an object with `start` and `stop` methods. The start and stop methods should each return a promise that resolves on success and rejects on error.
###### GET /
When a client makes a GET request to / the server should send baack html with a project description and a anchor to /cowsay.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <header>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="/cowsay">cowsay</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   <header>
   <main>
     <!-- project description -->
   </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### GET /cowsay?text={message}
When a client makes a GET request to /cowsay?text={message} the server should parse the querystring for a text key. It should then send a rendered HTML page with a cowsay cow speaking the value of the text query. If their is no text query the cow message should say `'I need something good to say!'`.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> cowsay </h1>
    <pre>
      <!-- cowsay.say({text: req.query.text}) -->
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### GET /api/cowsay?text={message}
When a client makes a POST request to /api/cowsay it should send JSON that includes `{"text": "<message>"}`. The server should respond with a JSON body `{"content": "<cowsay cow>"}`.

A response for a valid Requests should have a status code of 200 and the JSON body
``` json
{
  "content": "<cowsay cow text>"
}
```

A response for a invalid Requests should have a status code of 400 and the JSON body...
```
{
  "error": "invalid request: text query required"
}
```

###### POST /api/cowsay
When a client makes a POST request to /api/cowsay it should send JSON that includes `{"text": "<message>"}`. The server should respond with a JSON body `{"content": "<cowsay cow>"}`.

| Request | Response Status Code | Response Type | Response Body |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| With out a body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: body required"}` |
| With out text property on the body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: text query required"}` |
| With text query | 200 | JSON | `{"content": "<cowsay cow text>"}` |


## Bonus
**1pts:** add the ability to change the cowfile on GET /cowsay, GET /api/cowsay, and POST /api/cowsay - **ex: dragon, sheep, etc**
